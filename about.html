<h1 class="about"> About Adelfa</h1>

<p class="container">
        I am originally from Dominican Republic. I came to the United States when I was 17 years old. 
    Three days after coming to the US, I started working in a beauty salon as a beutician and went to High School at the same time. 
    I then worked in a department store. I moved from New Jersey to New York and had to change jobs again. I worked in a fast food restaurant (Taco Bell) for 
    3 years and half and became the asistant manager, while going to college at the same time. From there I went to explore the world of Real Estate and became 
    a real estate agent and office manager. From there, I went to work to Apple Bank for 
    about two years. Then I went to Commerce Bank  for 4 months. A few months after my college graduation, I started working at the UN where I 
    have been for the last 15 years. In 2009, I opened my own remodeling business in which I did almost everything (from website creation, to marketing, 
    accoutting, payroll, contracts, procurement, and insurance) except for renovations, but closed in 2017 for personal reasons.     
    I am about to finish my master degree in Business Administration. I have been learning and enjoying the studies greatly. </p>
 
    <p class="container">
    On a personal note, I am a dreamer and a fighter who believes in opportunities, and that one can get everything in life through effort and sacrifice. 
        I am married and have three children (13, 8, and 2 years old). I like spending time with my family watching a movie or just eating together. 
I enjoy singing karaoke, dancing, and going shopping. I love gardening and see my plants and flowers grow. I also like having friends at home and cooking for them and doing barbecues in the summer.
 I love going on vacation and going to Punta Cana to enjoy the all-inclusive hotel resorts.

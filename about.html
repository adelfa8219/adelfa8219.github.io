<h1> About Adelfa</h1>

<p>
I am originally from Dominican Republic. I came to the United States when I was 17 years old. After graduating from college, I started 
working for the United Nations. I currently work as an Information Systems assistant. 
I have a bachelorâ€™s in computer information system in criminal justice and public administration from John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
I am about to finish my master degree in Business Administration. I have been learning and enjoying the studies greatly.

I am married and have three children (13, 8, and 2 years old). I like spending time with my family watching a movie or just eating together. 
I enjoy singing karaoke, dancing, and going shopping. 
I also like having friends at home and cooking for them and doing barbecues in the summer.
 I love going on vacation and going to Punta Cana to enjoy the all-inclusive hotel resorts.
